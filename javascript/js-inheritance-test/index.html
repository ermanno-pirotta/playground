       Javascript inheritance tests, using jquery.extend. Please have a look at your console to see the output.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, a vehicle class defines a #honk and #getName methods. The truck class inherits from the vehicle one and overrides the #getName method and defines the #superHonk method. A bike class also inherits from vehicle, and overrides only the name.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that this is not proper inheritance, but serves as a base to design hierarchies of singleton objects. This objects are designed with the module pattern approach, and can re-use and override "parent's" methods.
